## 📖 Overview

The **Advanced Weather Dashboard** is a powerful web app that fetches and displays real-time weather conditions for any city, along with a 4-day forecast. What makes this app smarter is its **"Use Current Location"** feature that automatically detects your location and fetches data accordingly, making it ideal for both local and travel weather needs.

This project uses the OpenWeatherMap API and includes intuitive layout, error handling, and dynamic rendering.
